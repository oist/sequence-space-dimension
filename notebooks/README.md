# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains all Jupyter notebooks used to generate the figures and analyses presented in the manuscript.

## - main_datasets_analysis.ipynb

Analysis of natural sequence datasets (Vertebrates, Enterobacterales, Gammaproteobacteria, COGs) and simulated protein families evolving from an ancestor.

Generates Figures:
- Main: 3, 4, 5A, 6D
- Supplementary: S4B, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13


## - dim_estimation_parameters_compare.ipynb

Testing and validating correlation dimension estimation across parameter choices (regression windows, alignment type).

Generates Figures:
- Supplementary: S2, S3, S14


## - simulate_and_measure_dim_on_points.ipynb

Simulation of Euclidean point clouds and comparison of MDS projections of point sets and protein families of different dimensionality. Validation of correlation dimension estimation on point sets of known dimensionality.

Generates Figures:
- Main: 2
- Supplementary: S1


## - compare_dim_to_random_seq.ipynb

Comparison between sequences evolving from an ancestor and random fit sequences. Investigation of the effect of sequence length, amino-acid usage, sample size on dimension estimation. 

Generates Figures:
- Main: 1B, 5B, 6A, 6B
- Supplementary: S4A, S5


## - finalize_datasets.ipynb

Assembles summary datasets from intermediate outputs generated by ../workflows/pipeline.sh and writes final .csv tables to ../data/.
